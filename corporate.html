			<h4>Brand name and logo</h4>
<img src="images/logos/wanderpaws_groen2.png" class="d-block mx-auto w-50" alt="logo">
<p>Our logo is built with the Fruit-Punch font, see production for more information about this font. In the logo, we have placed the round shapes in a playful way, adding bumps but also playfulness. The bumps in the road are the reason WanderPaws exists; we smooth out the bumps by preparing you well for your next trip with your dog. The heart in the W represents a dog's nose and the love between humans and animals; the W actually forms a kind of human cheering with joy. In the letter A, you see a dog's paw, a logical connection to the dog. In the line towards the location, you see a curl, which is yet another kind of dog nose making its way to the destination. See production for the meaning of our brand name.</p>

<h4>Brand Vision</h4>
<p>At WanderPaws, we picture a world in which your dog is a true companion on every adventure, not just an afterthought. For dog lovers who travel the world with their furry companions, we are the community and go-to resource. We make travels simpler, happier, and less stressful by providing trustworthy, useful, and inspirational travel information. From transport tips to real-life stories, we empower and connect a growing community of pet-loving adventurers. Because we believe that the best memories are created when paws are involved in the adventure.</p>

<h4>Brand Values</h4>
<p>Our brand values are very important to us, we strive to always uphold them and convey them to the people who will use our website.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Community: Fostering a space where dog lovers can share experiences and insights.</li>
  <li>Caring: Recognizing the deep bond between owner and animal by offering thoughtful tips and practical tools to ensure every trip is safe and stress-free.</li>
  <li>Adventurous: Encouraging exploration and discovery with pets.</li>
  <li>Freedom: Empowering owners and their dogs to explore the world together.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Brand Persona</h4>
<img src="images/corporate/content/brandpersona.jpg" class="d-block mx-auto w-50" alt="persona">
<p>Meet Olivia – Olivia is a 27-year-old freelance photographer living in Amsterdam, where she balances her creative career with her greatest passion: adventuring alongside her Labrador, Milo. With a background in marketing and a spirit for spontaneous getaways, Olivia seeks experiences that nourish both her curiosity and her bond with Milo.</p>
<p>Her lifestyle reflects everything WanderPaws stands for: joy in shared moments, care for her furry friend, and the desire to explore without limits. Olivia values travel that’s not only seamless and safe for pets, but also rich with inspiration and connection. Whether capturing content to inspire other dog lovers or scouting out dog-friendly spots, she embodies a community of explorers who see their pets not as baggage, but as the very heart of the journey.</p>

<h4>Visual Identity and Supporting Visuals</h4>
<p>Our visual style is extensively explained under the heading Production. This style has emerged from a deep understanding of our target audience, based on interviews and research. From these insights, we developed a persona: Olivia, an adventurous 21-year-old who enjoys spending time in nature with her Labrador Milo.</p>
<p>From Olivia's world and preferences, we further developed our visual concept. Because our target audience largely consists of Gen Z, we tapped into their love for nostalgia and their preference for bright, striking colors. This color choice also aligns with a broader trend in graphic design over the past few years, where expressive, vibrant colors have become increasingly popular.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a playful and accessible style that matches the joy of being with your dog. That's why we chose a fresh and youthful visual style that evokes the simplicity of being young. This translates into flat illustrations, clear designs, and a color palette that exudes energy and cheerfulness. The result is a style that is not only visually appealing but also perfectly aligns with the experience of our target audience.</p>
<p>We make use of a lot of real life pictures from dogs and their owners, this is something we do on purpose to create a feeling, you can relate to it, you will feel connected to real life pictures and stories. We hope that by this, it can be a small help to make people excited about our community.</p>
<p>To be honest we kept it simple for now with the supporting illustrations, in the future it would be fun to create some moving illustrations over the page. But for now, this was beyond our current technical knowledge. </p>

<p>Where the adventure starts: WanderPaws's backstory</p>

<p>Wanderlust, the intense desire to travel the world, and Paws, the little footsteps of our loyal companions who are by our sides no matter what, were the inspiration for WanderPaws. Together, they represent our brand's core values: a love for adventure, nature, and the unbreakable bond between humans and their dogs. WanderPaws is here to encourage happy, stress-free trips with your pet, whether you're hiking mountains, chasing sunsets, or simply exploring new cities.</p>

<h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
<p>Our colors, a conscious choice.</p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend in the graphic design industry: vibrant colours are returning. In addition to drawing attention, these vivid colours trigger feelings and improve the design's overall experience. As a result, we have consciously decided to use vibrant colours.</p>

<p>Our inner kid is symbolised by the flat shapes we employ. Even though the target audience is a little older, we find that they are the ones who love nostalgia the most. It brings back memories of freedom, play, and simplicity. Besides, it's a fact that spending time with your dog naturally brings out the spontaneous, childish side of you. You take a minute to relax, play, and laugh.</p>

<p>The color choice fits seamlessly with this. They fit perfectly with the playfulness of both humans and animals, and they also reflect the shapes and colors we see in nature. This creates a cheerful, recognizable, and inviting style that perfectly aligns with the feeling we want to convey.</p>

        <em>Bright Green symbolizes grass, nature, energy, and adventure. It's a colour that instantly transports you to the outdoors, where you feel liberated, lively, and active. That's exactly what happens when you and your dog travel the world, this is why we see it as the most important color of our brand.</em>

<h4>Font choices</h4>
<p>Fruit-Punch</p>
<p>Fruit Punch, an exciting and welcoming typeface with rounded forms that instantly grab attention, is the font we've chosen for the headers. Its soft curves give the text an approachable and pleasant tone, which wonderfully captures the happy vibe of being with your dog. Just like a fun day out together, this typeface conveys a feeling of fun and energy. It brings a fresh, youthful vibe to the design, while also making the content feel welcoming and engaging. In addition to improving the overall mood, this choice gives the page an exciting, dynamic vibe.</p>
			
	<p>Inter Bold/Inter Regular</p>
<p>We've selected Inter Regular for the body text and Inter Bold for the subheadings in this design. This combination provides the layout a modern feel and a clear, readable appearance. A timeless, simplified look is added by using a sans-serif font, which makes it both aesthetically pleasing and adaptable. The font's absence of serifs gives it a modern, youthful look without sacrificing professionalism. All things considered, it's a straightforward but efficient design decision that guarantees the information is aesthetically pleasing and easily readable.
</p>
	<h4>User interface patterns</h4>
<p>The layout of the website is grid-based. For instance, the three primary options on the homepage ("Travel by Car, Plane, or Boat") are displayed in equal rectangles.
The user experiences are arranged in three columns, side by side, in the community stories at the bottom of the community page.
</p>
<p>Theory: According to Lidwell et al.'s Universal Principles of Design, this adheres to the design concept of alignment and visual hierarchy.  Grids provide consistency, order, and serenity.  They facilitate the speedy scanning of visual information by users.
</p>
<p>(Source: Lidwell, W., Holden, K., Butler, J. (2010))</p>
<p>Cards are used as a UI pattern on the website (e.g., the community stories and travel tiles).  Every card has a picture, title, date, and a brief synopsis.</p>
<p>Theory: Cards are a popular pattern for chunking content because they guarantee a strong separation between content units and make information interactive and scannable (Material Design Guidelines).</p>
<p>(Sources: Google Material Design Guidelines, content chunking)</p>
<p>Menu Structure (Navigation) is at the top, on a horizontal menu bar, is the main navigation:
"Travel by" (with dropdown), "Comunnity", "Corporate"
</p>
<p>Theory: This arrangement aligns with the traditional F-pattern of online users (Nielsen Norman Group), which states that they mainly look at a page's left vertical and top horizontal sections.</p>
<p>(Sources: Nielsen, J. (2006). F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content)
</p>
<p>For visual storytelling, a horizontal image carousel is employed on certain pages (like the "Travelling by Car" page).</p>
<p>Theory: When displaying visually rich content (such pictures of dogs on the go) in a condensed amount of space, a carousel design is frequently applied. Carousels are only useful if they can be manually navigated or rotate slowly.
</p>
<p>(Sources: Nielsen, J. (2006). Auto-Forwarding Carousels and Accordions Annoy Users and Reduce Visibility)</p>
<h4>Content Development and Navigation Structure</h4>
<p>
The structure of the homepage is obvious:
</p>
			<ul>
  <li>A mission and vision statement in the introduction</li>
  <li>Call to Action: "Observe what other people have gone through"</li>
  <li>Selecting a transport option (3 cards)</li>
  <li>A footer featuring social media and the logo</li>
				</ul>
	<p></p>
<p>Theory: The AIDA model (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) is followed by this structure, in which the visitor is informed before having a choice.</p>
<p>(Sources: Cooper, A., Reimann, R., Cronin, D., Noessel, C. (2014). About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design.)</p>
<p>Content pages (car, boat, plane, train), every form of transportation has its own page with:
</p>
			<ul>
<li>A visually appealing banner; well-organised suggestions with distinct titles in eye-catching hues like orange or green</li>
	<li>Lists with bullet points</li>
	<li>Provide a link to pertinent companies or products</li>
</ul>
<p>Theory: 
This is consistent with progressive disclosure, which divides complex information into manageable portions to prevent user overload.
</p>
<p>(Sources: Cialdini, R. B. (2007). Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.)</p>
<p>The community page has a clear call to action ("Join the Community!").
An explanation of the advantages
User tale content in cards; a form for sharing your own story
</p>
<p>Theory: Engagement and trust are developed through the usage of user-generated material and social proof, or other people's tales; this enhances the feeling of community.</p>
<p>(Sources: Kotler, P., Armstrong, G. (2017). Principles of Marketing.)</p>
<h4>How does website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</h4>
<p>Every element of the WanderPaws website design captures the brand's light-hearted, adventurous, and friendly nature. We connect travelling with your dog with feelings of freedom, spontaneity, and childish enthusiasm, all of which are expressed by the use of vivid colours, soft rounded type like Fruit Punch, and straightforward flat shapes. The brand's key values: Community, Caring, Adventurous and Freedom, are reflected in these design decisions. The user is encouraged to explore because of the layout's openness and friendliness. It's more than simply a site, it's an experience that evokes the vibes of an exciting road trip or a sunny stroll through the woods, complete with tail wags.</p>
<h4>How does website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</h4>
<p>Building an active community, encouraging stress-free travel, and establishing a connection with adventurous dog owners between the ages of 25 and 35 are the main objectives of WanderPaws marketing and communication approach. The website's visual attractiveness, emotional resonance, and ease of use all contribute to this tactic. The design promotes interaction and sharing by utilising user-generated content, Reels-ready graphics, and obvious calls to action. The grid-based structure, cards, and progressive content disclosure match the social-media-like flow users are already familiar with. All things considered, the design facilitates the conversion of visitors into devoted community members and curiosity into connection.</p>
<h4>How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</h4>
<p>What makes WanderPaws unique is that we offer not just practical travel advice for dog owners, but an entire lifestyle of joyful, stress-free adventures. The website emphasises this special value by striking a balance between emotional narrative (community experiences, upbeat images, and amusing design features) and useful content (such as product links and suggestions relevant to transportation). Everything is intended to demonstrate that WanderPaws is not just educational but also uplifting, reliable, and incredibly relatable. Users can feel seen, encouraged, and eager to go on their next adventure with their pet thanks to the content structure, lively colour scheme, and amiable typefaces.</p>

<h3>Protocol 3</h3>

<h4>Participant 3</h4>

<h4>Setting</h4>

<p>On campus, where we gave our laptop with website on it.</p>

<h4>Protocol</h4>

<p>You want to know to more about travelling with a dog in the car, then you specifically want to look more into buying stuff as recommended</p>

<h4>UI/UX Testing Results Summary</h4>

<h4>Positive aspacts</h4>

<p>Successful Task Completion</p>
<p>The user was able to complete both tasks easily.She found the information about traveling with a dog by car. And Located and followed links to recommended products like SleepyPod and Amazon. This shows that the site has a logical structure and useful links.</p>

<p>Clarity and Usefulness of Product Recommendations</p>
<p>The redirection to trusted vendors (Amazon, SleepyPod) was seen as “very handy.” The external links, built trust and added value, which makes it easy for users to act on the advice given.</p>

<p>Visual Design and Tone</p>
<p>The tester appreciated the playful, colorful aesthetic, calling it “really nice.” This suggests a successful alignment of visual style with the brand identity, particularly appealing for a pet-friendly audience.</p>

<p>Content Depth</p>
<p>The user found the content detailed and informative, commenting that “there’s a lot of information,” which helped them understand the travel process better. This indicates that the content fulfills the informational needs of the user.</p>

<h4>Negative Aspects</h4>

<p>Initial Navigation Confusion</p>
<p>The user admitted to missing the main navigation tabs at first, even though the needed content (Car) was easy to find once noticed. This implies that the primary nav menu could benefit from stronger visual emphasis or a clearer call to action.</p>

<p>Homepage Overload</p>
<p>The user spent some time scrolling through the homepage to find their way, which indicates a slight overwhelm or a lack of immediate direction for task-driven visitors. This highlights a possible improvement area in homepage information hierarchy or scannability.</p>

<h4>Implememted Improvements</h4>

<p>Streamlined Navigation Tabs</p>
<p>Each mode of transportation is now clearly labeled in both the navigation bar and homepage card section to ensure easier and faster recognition.</p>

<p>Clickable Cards with Better Clarity</p>
<p>All “Check out!” buttons within the transport cards were made more prominent to encourage interaction, helping users like this one to find their desired section faster.</p>

<p>External Shopping Links Refined</p>
<p>Product recommendation links are now consistently labeled, and open in new tabs to improve user flow and avoid breaking the site session</p>

<h4>Planned/Recommended Improvements</h4>

<p>To avoid the homepage confusion described, we plan to add a brief “Get Started" suggestion banner or arrow animation that guides users to the transport options.</p>
<p>On top of that we want to make the navigation menu more visually engaging on first load.</p>
<p>And Lastly to Add a "Recommended Products" Section or Shortcut. Since the user found great value in the product recommendations, we may add a dedicated Gear and Essentials section to the main menu. Or include a sticky sidebar or link on each travel page.</p>

<h3>Protocol 4</h3>

<h4>Participant 4</h4>

<p>We asked a dog owner to use our website specifically for traveling with a car</p>

<h4>Setting</h4>

<p>On campus, where we gave our laptop with website on it.</p>

<h4>Protocol</h4>

<p>What do you think the website is about when only looking at the homepage</p>

<h4>UI/UX Testing Results Summary</h4>

<h4>Positive Aspects</h4>

<p>Clear Core Concept</p>
<p>The tester was able to quickly identify the main purpose of the website. They noted that the theme was clear through visual elements, such as the visuals of dogs, even before reading detailed text.</p>

<p>Valuable Content Structure</p>
<p>The user appreciated the inclusion of practical advice and instructions, highlighting that it provides helpful guidance on how to travel safely with a dog.</p>

<p>Community Features</p>

<p>Design Appeal</p>
<p>Visual elements such as the homepage layout, icons, and content variety, such as the carousel, cards and imagery, were received positively. The structure supports skimming and exploration.</p>

<h4>Negative Aspects</h4>

<p>Initial Uncertainty</p>
<p>The user mentioned being “a bit lost at the beginning,” primarily due to not immediately noticing the homepage description or guidance text. This suggests a lack of immediate clarity or visual hierarchy in explaining the site's purpose.</p>

<p>Delayed Understanding of Key Features</p>
<p>Although the user did eventually understand the site's purpose, there was a slight delay in connecting all features (like community and experience sharing) with the main theme. This may imply a need for more guided onboarding or clearer section headers.</p>

<h4>Implemented Improvements</h4>

<p>Improved Heading Hierarchy and Font Sizes</p>
<p>The main headline now uses a larger, colored font to immediately signal the site’s core message: "Welcome to WanderPaws!"</p>

<p>Stronger Visual Pairing</p>
<p>The combination of carousel tips and a clear image of a dog traveling better reinforces the site's theme at first glance.</p>

<p>Community Section Highlighted</p>
<p>The “See what others have experienced” section has been repositioned and restyled to emphasize user interaction and inspire engagement earlier in the homepage journey</p>

<h4>Planned/Recommended Improvements</h4>

<p>Add a Short Intro Paragraph or Tagline at the Top</p>
<p>To address initial confusion, a concise mission statement or tagline will be added below the headline to immediately clarify the site’s purpose.</p>

<p>Clickable Cards Enhancement</p>
<p>Making the “Travel by” cards more visually interactive, like the use of hover animations will help users instinctively know they can be clicked.</p>

<p>Optional Onboarding Banner or Tooltip</p>
<p>A pop-up hint on first visit, could offer users quick direction and reduce early confusion.</p>

 <h4>Summary testing protocol</h4>
		<p>When we began testing the WanderPaws website, we had four core usability goals in mind: that users should easily understand and navigate the site’s structure; that the interface should feel intuitive and predictable; that users should be able to complete tasks without confusion; and that the purpose of the website should be immediately clear.

Across all four testing rounds, the feedback we received strongly aligned with these objectives. Most users navigated the site smoothly, moving from general to specific pages without getting lost. This suggests that the structure was, indeed, clear and user-friendly. Whether participants were searching for airline-specific travel rules or browsing the community page, they found what they were looking for with minimal effort.

The interface itself was described as playful yet functional. Testers mentioned how “smooth” and “easy” interactions felt, reinforcing the idea that the site is intuitive to use. Tasks such as browsing travel info, exploring community stories, or even engaging with shopping links were completed successfully, with users rarely needing help or additional instruction.

Participants were also quick to understand what the website was about, even from just the visuals and layout on the homepage. The presence of dogs, interactive features, and clear content themes made the platform’s mission recognizable early on. Some users did express slight confusion at the start. Particularly when encountering the homepage for the first time, but this was more about visual emphasis and onboarding than a lack of clarity in concept.</p>

  <h3>Target audience</h3>

  <h4>1. Who is the target audience?</h4>
  <p>Our primary audience consists of travelers aged 25 to 35 who consider their dogs an essential part of their lifestyle and travel plans. This demographic is characterized by a love for outdoor adventures, such as hiking, road trips, and exploring new destinations with their pets (KRC Research et al., 2021). They are digitally savvy, socially active, and often make purchasing or travel decisions based on peer recommendations and user-generated content (Nelloolichalil, 2024).</p>

  <h4>2. Interests and lifestyle</h4>
  <p>These travelers are not just occasional pet parents, but they are fully committed to including their dogs in their day-to-day lives and long-term plans. As they wait for kids, they treat pets as proper substitutes (Pet Owner Behavior - Statistics and Trends | Promodo.com, n.d.). Their core interests include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Traveling (both domestic and international)</li>
    <li>Pet care and canine health</li>
    <li>Camping, hiking, beach trips, and road trips</li>
    <li>Content creation (photography and video featuring their pets)</li>
    <li>Pet gear and travel accessories</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(Staff et al., 2016)</p>

  <h4>3. Pain points</h4>
  <p>Despite their enthusiasm, these travelers face multiple frustrations (Cosgrove, 2025):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unclear travel regulations (varies per airline, train company, cruise line, country)</li>
    <li>Limited pet-friendly accommodations and transport options</li>
    <li>Logistical stress (navigating public transport with a dog, managing crates and paperwork, etc.)</li>
    <li>Inconsistent online information: often outdated or buried in policy documents</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These pain points directly influence their search behavior and content preferences.</p>

    <li>Usage: Platforms for community building, discussions, and QandA sessions</li>
    <li>Behavior: Pet owners join groups focused on pet-friendly travel to share experiences and seek advice</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Media tactics</h3>
  <p>We will be using Instagram as our media platform to promote our brand. On Instagram, we will have an account for our brand WanderPaws where we will promote our brand and our website.</p>

  <p>We will use Instagram because it is the ideal platform to reach our target audience: millennial travelers aged 25–35 who include their dogs in every adventure. With over 30.6% of global users in this age group (Statista, 2024), Instagram aligns really well with their mobile-first, visually driven behavior.</p>

  <p>Millennials prefer authentic, short-form content like Reels and Stories. They seek travel inspiration, share personal experiences, and follow creators with similar lifestyles. Our content, such as dog-friendly travel tips and dog photos, fits naturally into their feed.</p>

  <p>Instagram also supports community building and peer recommendations, which are key to our audience’s decision-making (Nelloolichalil, 2024). By posting during peak engagement times (Food, 2022) and using targeted hashtags, we can drive both engagement and traffic to our website. Instagram lets us meet our audience with the right tone, content, and timing.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h2>
           <h3>Our brand: campaign evaluation</h3>

    <p>Overall, our campaign went really well. We stayed focused on our objectives and created content tailored specifically to our target audience, based on the research we conducted. Through this, we discovered that our audience responds most positively to content that is fun, exciting, and visually engaging. Reels, in particular, performed well, which is why we strategically used a mix of both reels and standard photo posts on our account.</p>

    <p>Each regular post featured a joyful, vibrant image of a dog and sometimes accompanied by their owner on an adventure. We carefully chose photos that sparked positivity and fun, steering away from serious tones or black-and-white imagery. We posted on the account around 3-4 times a week and all on different days, to keep obtaining people's attention. All visuals were sourced from non-copyrighted platforms such as Pexels and Unsplash. Every post had a unique subject and a caption tailored to both the image and the message we wanted to share. For example, a photo of a dog in a car was paired with a caption offering tips on managing car travel with pets and highlighting how WanderPaws is here to help.</p>

    <p>We aimed for a balanced approach: half of our content subtly promoted our website and services to drive traffic, while the other half reinforced our brand identity and values. Posts like “Just you and me, on an adventure. There’s nothing better than this feeling” may not directly advertise our offerings but strongly communicate what we stand for.</p>

    <p>We also experimented with different formats such as Instagram Stories and Reels. Our reels, inspired by current meme trends and lighthearted humor, resonated well with our audience, with them reaching over 200 views. This style aligns really well with our approachable, playful brand identity. Stories were used not just to repost adventure-themed videos from other creators (which aligns with our values), but also to build community engagement. We asked followers questions like “What do you enjoy most when adventuring with your dog?” and received responses out of it, showing that our efforts to spark conversation did work. We also invited our audience to share their own adventure videos, and a few people did. Which we reposted, further strengthening that sense of community.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation of marketing objectives:</h3>

    <h4>objectives:</h4>

    <p>Reach Objective: Reach at least 300 people of our target audience on our social media platform within the first 4 weeks.</p>

    <p>Affect: Inspire and educate our target audience, making them feel confident about traveling with their dogs, leading to at least 50 meaningful interactions (likes, comments, shares).</p>

    <p>Response: Creating a community on our page by obtaining at least 150 followers.</p>

    <h4>1. Reach objective</h4>

    <p>We definitely achieved this objective. Looking at the reach, we have reached a lot more than 300 people. We aimed to reach at least 300 people within the first four weeks, this being 300 people from our target audience. We far surpassed this target. According to Instagram analytics, our profile reached 3,217 accounts during this period. This means that 3,2 thousand people have seen our posts in total. Of those, 68.1% were followers, and 31.9% were non-followers, suggesting that our hashtags were effective in expanding reach beyond our existing following. Our most viewed post was our very first reel, reinforcing the research that reels generate the highest visibility and work the best for getting the most reach. We have also seen that 55% from this reach is aged 18-24, and 26,5% is aged 25-34. The last age group is our target audience. This is less than we expected but if we calculate the percentage to a number, 26,5 percent of 3,217 are still 852 people from our intended target audience, which means we achieved our reach objective.</p>

    <h4>2. Affect objective</h4>

    <p>Looking at the affect, we also achieved our objective of having at least 50 interactions. According to our Instagram statistics, we have 186 interactions. These interactions range from likes, comments and shares. Interestingly, 90.4% of these came from our followers, which shows that we’re successfully building a loyal and engaged community. 84,1 percent out of the 186 interactions have been on normal posts. Which means that posts do work the best interaction wise, which is the opposite of which format gets the most reach. 179 out of the 186 have been likes and 6 have been comments. Which is a lot less than we anticipating. But we did get a lot more likes in total than we expected which was pleasantly surprising to see. But we did achieve our affect objective and surpassed it in a great way. We also received a few DMs with partnership offers, which was an exciting and unexpected bonus.</p>

    <h4>3. Response objective</h4>

    <p>Looking at the response objective, we also achieved this. Our goal was to gain at least 150 followers within four weeks. We obtained in total 168 followers. Which are quite a lot of people. We did not expect this number to be this high and we were even a little skeptical of reaching this objective. We in total have had 174 of which 5 unfollowed us.  However, this is still a very low number, this indicates that people not only found our content engaging but also chose to stick around, helping build a true community. In total we have shared 27 posts which helped us build that community. Within those posts, there was room and multiple occasions for engagement.</p>

    <h3>Key learnings</h3>

    <h4>What worked well</h4>

    <p>One of the most successful elements of the campaign was the use of Reels for reach. Reels significantly outperformed other types of content in terms of visibility, with our very first reel gaining over 200 views. This reinforced both our initial research and real-world results that Instagram’s algorithm tends to favor short-form video content, especially when it's engaging and on-trend.</p>

    <p>Another area that performed well was our use of Instagram Stories. We used Stories to ask interactive questions and repost user-generated content (UGC), which helped foster more genuine, two-way communication with our audience. Interestingly, we found that users were more willing to engage via Stories than to leave comments on static posts.</p>

    <p>Our consistent tone and aesthetic also proved effective. We stayed true to a joyful and adventurous visual identity, using bright and happy images, primarily of dogs exploring the outdoors. These visuals, paired with light-hearted and friendly captions, helped us build a strong brand presence that resonated with our target community.</p>

    <p>Audience growth exceeded our expectations. We set a goal of reaching 150 followers within four weeks and ended up with 168. We even received several direct messages with offers for collaborations, suggesting that our brand made a strong impression and connected well with a niche but engaged audience.</p>

    <h4>What did not work or went unexpectedly</h4>

    <p>However, not everything went as smoothly. One area that underperformed was comment engagement. Despite including open-ended questions in many of our captions, we received fewer comments than expected. We discovered that while users are happy to like a post or engage via Stories, getting them to comment on feed posts requires more compelling emotional or thought-provoking content, not just questions.</p>

    <p>Another challenge was overestimating the consistency of likes. We initially assumed that likes would gradually increase as our page grew, but engagement fluctuated quite a bit. Some posts we thought would perform well, especially those that were visually strong, underperformed, while others unexpectedly gained a lot of traction. This showed us how unpredictable engagement can be.</p>

    <p>User-generated content also had a slower start than anticipated. Although we did receive some submissions of dogs on adventures, participation was lower than expected. In hindsight, launching this aspect of the campaign with a clearer structure, like a branded hashtag challenge or a small incentive, might have encouraged more users to take part from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Another unexpected insight came from our reach demographics. We had assumed that most of our reach would come from our primary target group, ages 25–34. However, only 26.5% of the 3,217 people reached were within this age range. While this was lower than expected, it still equates to around 852 people from our target audience, which is a solid number and above our objective of 300 people. It showed us that we were successful in reaching our intended group, just not in the proportion we initially predicted.</p>

    <h4>What went as expected</h4>

    <p>Some aspects of the campaign did go exactly as planned. We followed our content calendar closely, posting three to four times per week, with only minor adjustments along the way. This helped maintain consistency and kept our audience engaged throughout the campaign.</p>

    <p>Our visual and messaging strategy also aligned perfectly with our goals. We set out to create a brand that celebrates fun, companionship, and adventure. And the feedback we received confirmed that this message resonated strongly with our audience.</p>

    <p>Lastly, our posting schedule was well-timed. Based on research, we decided to post during the afternoon, which proved effective in terms of both reach and engagement. The analytics backed this decision, showing higher performance during these times.</p>

    <h4>What did we learn</h4>

    <p>Overall, we learned how to actually execute a campaign and not just make one. For us, it was quite easy to follow our content calendar, we did make some changes along the way but followed it well. We also always tried to post them in the afternoon, which is when our target audience is the most on social media according to research. Instagram has the function to save concepts which made it easier to follow the time schedule. Looking at the KPI’s we set for each post on the content calendar we also achieved a lot of them, especially the following. The likes on the other hand we did not always reach. So that is something we overestimated. We expected it to be more every post but sometimes the likes went up and down. Because of that we learned that those kinds of interactions are hard to estimate.</p>

    <h4>What we would do differently</h4>

    <p>Something that we would do differently next time is to experiment more with reels. Since Reels brought in the most reach, we would create more short-form video content in the future, especially using trends or storytelling formats that are popular with our audience. Secondly, we would improve comment engagement. We would rethink how we encourage comments, perhaps by using more emotionally driven storytelling or adding stronger calls-to-action in captions. Collaborations or giveaways might also help boost comment rates. On top of that we would also do more with user-generated Content, since community-driven content got a strong response, we’d start collecting and showcasing user submissions earlier in the campaign.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p>In conclusion, our campaign not only met but exceeded all of our objectives. We gained valuable experience in creating and executing a full campaign, learned what types of content our audience connects with most, and laid a strong foundation for WanderPaws' future presence on social media. Most importantly, we began building a community of like-minded, dog-loving adventurers, exactly the kind of audience we set out to reach.</p>
          <h2 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h2>

<p>Reflecting on our completed campaign, it's clear that we laid a solid foundation in terms of building brand awareness, reaching our target audience, and establishing a community around our brand values. However, should this project continue, there are several opportunities to build on our success, improve engagement, and develop the campaign into a more strategic, long-term effort. This section outlines in detail what we would do differently, new ideas for content, and what I’ve learned through the process.</p>

<h3>Reflection on what has been done</h3>

<p>During this project, we focused on creating joyful, visually appealing content that aligns with our brand identity: playful, adventurous, and community focused. Our use of both photo posts and reels helped us discover that reels generate significantly more reach, while photo posts foster more consistent interaction (mainly likes). We also utilized Instagram Stories effectively to build direct engagement with our audience through questions and reposted content.</p>

<p>We hit all three of our initial objectives, by reaching over 3,200 people, sparking 186 interactions, and increasing our audience to 168 followers. But through this, we will identify clear areas where we could grow further, both in creative strategy and marketing structure.</p>

<h3>What we would do differently and why</h3>

<h4>1. Implement a long-term content strategy</h4>

<p>While our initial content calendar worked well for short-term consistency, future planning would benefit from a more strategic, long-term approach. We would create a 3-month content calendar with rotating content themes. Some ideas we have for this are “Training Tuesdays,” “Adventure Highlights,” “WanderPaws Wisdom”. This allows us to build expectations with our audience and explore a broader variety of topics. We would do this because content that follows themes is easier to plan and gives followers a reason to return. It also increases post consistency while giving the brand a clear voice.</p>

<h4>2. Prioritize Reels and storytelling content</h4>

<p>We saw from our analytics that reels received the most reach, yet we only created a few. If we continued the project, we would focus more on reels, and in them we would add more storytelling and narrative elements, such as “A day in the life of a traveling dog” or “Tips for packing for you and your pup.” These would combine value-driven content with emotional storytelling, encouraging shares and saves. This can be good for our brand as storytelling increases emotional resonance, which is key to building brand loyalty and shareable content. Reels are also favored by Instagram's algorithm, making them a priority format.</p>

<h4>3. Use a community Hashtag and UGC campaign</h4>

<p>To further grow our community, we would launch an official campaign hashtag, for example the hashtag: #WanderWithPaws. And encourage followers to use it when posting their own dog adventure photos or videos. Each week, we could feature our favorite submissions in a “Community Spotlight” post or story. We would do this because user-generated content (UGC) builds authenticity and strengthens community ties. According to Nielsen research, 92% of consumers trust UGC more than traditional advertising. It also provides ongoing content with minimal effort.</p>

<h4>4. Posting more carousel posts</h4>

<p>While most of our content was visual and emotive, we would introduce more educational carousel posts with practical advice, like “5 Tips for Road Tripping with Your Dog” or “Best Dog-Friendly Destinations in Europe.” Carousel posts increase time spent on each post, are highly shareable, and encourage saving, which boosts the algorithm performance of Instagram. They also reinforce our position as a helpful, knowledgeable resource and not just an aesthetic brand. These posts could mix text with icons or playful illustrations to stay on-brand while delivering useful info.</p>

<h4>5. Experiment with Collaborations and Micro-Influencers</h4>

<p>If we were to grow to a big brand with a budget. We could eventually reach out to micro-influencers in the pet travel niche for shoutouts, takeovers, or collaborative content. For example, a travel influencer with a dog could “take over” our stories for a day and share their travel routine, tagging us throughout. Influencer collaborations can really increase our brand reach. Micro-influencers are especially trusted and have stronger engagement rates than larger accounts, which is more valuable for community-focused brands.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If the campaign were to continue, we would shift the strategy from short-term visibility to long-term community building and brand authority. This would involve expanding our content types, deepening the storytelling, involving our audience more through UGC and collaborations, and keeping content both visually appealing and value-driven.</p>

<p>The campaign showed us the power of authentic branding and the importance of continuous testing and learning. By applying these insights, I believe WanderPaws could evolve into a lasting brand that shares a bond with a dog-loving community.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problems</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lack of centralized and reliable information on dog-friendly travel options. </li>
            <li>Traveling with dogs can be stressful due to unknown regulations and limitations. </li>

			<li>Alternatives: Alternatives right now for this are websites from travel agencies themselves. Communities on other channels such as Facebook. Youtube content that helpes people with their preparation, such as checklists, experiences and recomendations.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized website with clear, up-to-date information on traveling with dogs by transport type (plane, train, car, etc.). </li>

			<li>Because of the solution interviews, we thought it would be efficient to add more advertisements to connect people with usefull travel products.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We target young adults age 25-35, because we found that mainly this group travels with their pet and are searching for information in pet-friendly travel.</li>
            <li>Dog owners, and cares about the well being of their dog.</li>

			<li>In our solution interviews we found that our target audience finds other people's opinions and experiences important. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>One central platform focused entirely on making dog-friendly travel easier and more joyful.</li>
            <li>Empowers dog owners to travel confidently and stress-free with their pets.</li>
			<li>Builds a community through shared experiences and honest, practical advice.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>List the aspect(s) of your brand that cannot easily be copied, also called your sustainable competitive advantage(s).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Instagram and our online webpage.</li>
            <li>After the solution interviews we also thought it would be effective to add Facebook and Tiktok to our channels. Mainly because we found that our target audience is active on these platforms.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>KPI's for social media and engagement posts. Think of engagement rate, likes, shares, comments and follower growth. This way we can measure how our platform is perceived and if our posts are effective.</li>
            <li>Subscription purchases, if we know how many people purchase a subscription then we know if our advertising and concept is effective.</li>
			<li>After the solution interviews, we realized that it is also very crucial to include our customer satisfaction, looking at feedback and reviews will get us answers about our brand and service.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
		  <p>Fixed costs</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website hosting, the website hosting will cost around €30,- per month according to the used source.</li>
          </ul>
			<p>Variable costs</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Paid marketing and advertising, to attract people to our service/website we need to advertise ourself. Because we want to advertise on Instagram and Facebook I looked at the prices Meta provides us. One of the lowest prices was around €300,- per month. </li>
			<li>Website maintenance, it is important that our website is being maintained. Looking at the average rate of vacatures in website maintenance, I came at a amount of €200,- per month.</li>
			<li>This makes a total of €530,- costs per month. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After the solution interviews we found out that almost everyone thought that a €3,99 subscription fee per month was too expensive. That is why we changed it to €10,- for a full year subscription. Assuming we would have 100 subscribers per month, total= €10,- x 100 people = €1000,- per month.</li>
            <li>Affiliate marketing, according to this source, the average revenue made from affiliate marketing for beginners lies between €0,- and €1000,-, so I took the middle which is €500,- per month. This is calculated assuming a 10% commition. </li>
			<li>This makes a total of €1500,- revenue per month.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We want people to be able to travel together with their pet, and don't feel like they are held back. We want people to feel free and adventurous, but also know how to care properly for their dog during travel. Our website will gather all information, so people will have less difficulty with planning their travel and can find everything in one place.</li>
          </ul>

		<!-- start of interview conclusions section -->
		  <h2 id="#Probleminterview" class="fw-bold">Problem interviews conclusions</h2>
			<p>During our problem interviews, we came across a few themes. I made a division of these themes and put down the most important challenges. </p>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">Time and Lifestyle </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Owners find it hard to make time for long walks, training, and regular feeding </li>
            <li>Daily routines are adjusted around the dog’s needs, affecting work, study, and social life. </li>
			<li>Vacation planning is difficult: Owners often avoid long trips or struggle with stressful accommodations. </li>
          </ul>
		
		  <p class="fw-bold">Product needs and Market Gaps </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Several owners complain that toys are destroyed quickly. </li>
            <li>Finding the right food, especially for sensitive stomachs, is confusing and expensive. </li>
			<li>Owners want better tools for dealing with shedding and dirty paws. </li>
          </ul>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">Travel and public spaces </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The travel options are limited and difficult. Plane travel is unclear, public transport rules are stressful, and not all places are pet friendly. </li>
            <li>Dog-unfriendly facilities: Stores, stations, and cities lack accommodations for dogs or their owners. </li>
			<li>Lack of fenced/off-leash areas: Especially problematic for reactive or strong dogs. </li>
          </ul>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">Behavioural issues </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Several dogs are aggressive toward other dogs or strangers, often due to trauma or lack of early socialization. </li>
            <li>Strong or rambunctious dogs are hard to walk or play with. </li>
			<li>Some dogs misbehave when left alone or get anxious in certain conditions, for example with firework. </li>
          </ul>
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">Emotional connection and community </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dogs are described as companions, family members, and emotional support. </li>
            <li>Owners love their dogs despite challenges and want the best for them. </li>
			<li>Interest in shared experiences, like Facebook groups or community tips, is strong. </li>
          </ul>
			
			
		  <p class="fw-bold">So, from these results, we can set up a few key opportunities. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Centralized, reliable travel info for dog owners </li>
            <li>Stronger, safer, more durable dog products </li>
			<li>More dog-friendly infrastructure (parks, travel spaces) </li>
			<li>Health, food, and training guidance tailored to individual dogs </li>
			<li>Emotional support and community-driven content </li>
          </ul>

			<li>People found the website (draft) trustworthy and would use it and even recommend to others. </li>
          </ul>
			
			<p class="fw-bold">Reactions on the community feature</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Real experiences from other dog owners are seen as valuable. </li>
            <li>Most participants prefer peer recommendations and reviews over corporate messaging. </li>
			<li>Most interviewees feel that community features boost confidence in decision-making. </li>
          </ul>
