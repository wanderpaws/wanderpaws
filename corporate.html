<h3>Target audience</h3>



<h4>1. Who is the target audience?</h4>

<p>Our primary audience consists of travelers aged 25 to 35 who consider their dogs an essential part of their lifestyle and travel plans. This demographic is characterized by a love for outdoor adventures, such as hiking, road trips, and exploring new destinations with their pets. (KRC Research et al., 2021) They are digitally savvy, socially active, and often make purchasing or travel decisions based on peer recommendations and user-generated content (Nelloolichalil, 2024).</p>

<h4>2. Interests and lifestyle</h4>

<p>These travelers are not just occasional pet parents, but they are fully committed to including their dogs in their day-to-day lives and long-term plans. As they wait for kids, they treat pets as proper substitutes (Pet Owner Behavior - Statistics and Trends | Promodo.com, z.d.) Their core interests include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traveling (both domestic and international)</li>
  <li>Pet care and canine health</li>
  <li>Camping, hiking, beach trips, and road trips</li>
  <li>Content creation (photography and video featuring their pets)</li>
  <li>Pet gear and travel accessories</li>
</ul>

<p>(Staff et al., 2016)</p>

<h4>3. Pain points</h4>

<p>Despite their enthusiasm, these travelers face multiple frustrations (Cosgrove, 2025):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Unclear travel regulations (varies per airline, train company, cruise line, country)</li>
  <li>Limited pet-friendly accommodations and transport options</li>
  <li>Logistical stress (navigating public transport with a dog, managing crates and paperwork, etc.)</li>
  <li>Inconsistent online information: often outdated or buried in policy documents</li>
</ul>

<p>These pain points directly influence their search behavior and content preferences.</p>

<h4>4. Online behavior and platform use</h4>

<p>This audience actively engages with content across several platforms, 30.6% of global Instagram users were aged between 25 and 34 years, as of april 2024, making this age group one of the largest on the platform (Statista, 2024).</p>

  <li>Visually oriented: Engaged by rich imagery and short-form videos.</li>
  <li>Community-focused: Rely on peer recommendations, user-generated content, and reviews.</li>
  <li>Purpose-driven: Support brands that reflect their values, especially related to animal welfare or sustainability.</li>

</ul>

<p>According to Opena (z.d.)</p>

<h4>Their preferred content formats:</h4>

</ul>

<p>(Goldschein, 2024b)</p>

</ul>

<h3>Media tactics</h3>

<p>We will be using Instagram as our media platform to promote our brand. On Instagram we will have an account for our brand WanderPaws where we will promote our brand and our website.</p>

<p>We will use Instagram because it is the ideal platform to reach our target audience: millennial travelers aged 25–35 who include their dogs in every adventure. With over 30.6% of global users in this age group (Statista, 2024), Instagram aligns really well with their mobile-first, visually driven behavior.</p>

<p>Millennials prefer authentic, short-form content like Reels and Stories. They seek travel inspiration, share personal experiences, and follow creators with similar lifestyles. Our content what we will be posting, such as dog-friendly travel tips and dog photos, fits naturally into their feed.</p>

<p>Instagram also supports community building and peer recommendations, which are key to our audience’s decision-making (Nelloolichalil, 2024). By posting during peak engagement times (Food, 2022) and using targeted hashtags, we can drive both engagement and traffic to our website. Instagram lets us meet our audience really well, with the right tone, content, and timing.</p>

  <h2>Context of our campaign</h2>
  <p>
    To effectively reach our target audience of millennial travelers (aged 25–35) who explore the world with their dogs, we are using
    Instagram as our primary platform. Our content will consist of posts that visualize and align with our brand identity, including
    dog-friendly travel tips, destination highlights, and inspiring travel visuals with captions that amplify the message of each post.
  </p>

  <p>
    We plan to deliver this through short-form videos on Stories, Reels, and regular posts. Each post will maintain a cohesive visual
    identity with a green border of playful shapes and our logo in the corner, reflecting our brand’s positive, energetic, and friendly
    tone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our communication style will be playful and informal, using fun emojis to mirror both our brand identity and the lifestyle of our
    audience; socially active dog lovers who value peer-led recommendations and content that feels exclusive, exciting, and experiential.
    We aim to create a sense of community and show that we’re here to help them navigate the world with their dogs, removing stress and
    uncertainty through easy-to-understand content.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, we want to support the idea of going on vacation with your dog by showcasing how amazing and memorable these
    experiences can be, through visually appealing images and videos. By doing so, we’ll ultimately drive traffic to our website.
  </p>

  <p>
    The tone of all content will remain positive and empowering, aligning with our vision of making dog-inclusive travel more accessible
    and joyful. Every post will be useful, visually engaging, and infused with purpose, building trust, encouraging interaction, and
    supporting our broader marketing goals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under each post, we’ll use relevant hashtags to expand our reach and encourage our followers to use them too, increasing engagement
    and community visibility.
  </p>

  <h4>Hashtags we will use</h4>

  <h3>Campaign objective</h3>
  <p>
    Looking at our marketing objectives, our focus in the first 4 weeks is on building awareness, fostering engagement, and growing a
    loyal community. We aim to reach at least 300 people in our target audience across our chosen platforms, ensuring our content is seen
    by a relevant and interested group.
  </p>

  <p>
    From there, we’re targeting at least 50 meaningful interactions. This includes likes, comments, shares, saves, and DMs. As these are key
    indicators that our content is resonating and building trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, we aim to grow a dedicated following of at least 150 dog-loving adventurers who align with our values and are excited to be

          <h2 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h2>
           <h3>Our brand: campaign evaluation</h3>

    <p>Overall, our campaign went really well. We stayed focused on our objectives and created content tailored specifically to our target audience, based on the research we conducted. Through this, we discovered that our audience responds most positively to content that is fun, exciting, and visually engaging. Reels, in particular, performed well, which is why we strategically used a mix of both reels and standard photo posts on our account.</p>

    <p>Each regular post featured a joyful, vibrant image of a dog and sometimes accompanied by their owner on an adventure. We carefully chose photos that sparked positivity and fun, steering away from serious tones or black-and-white imagery. We posted on the account around 3-4 times a week and all on different days, to keep obtaining people's attention. All visuals were sourced from non-copyrighted platforms such as Pexels and Unsplash. Every post had a unique subject and a caption tailored to both the image and the message we wanted to share. For example, a photo of a dog in a car was paired with a caption offering tips on managing car travel with pets and highlighting how WanderPaws is here to help.</p>

    <p>We aimed for a balanced approach: half of our content subtly promoted our website and services to drive traffic, while the other half reinforced our brand identity and values. Posts like “Just you and me, on an adventure. There’s nothing better than this feeling” may not directly advertise our offerings but strongly communicate what we stand for.</p>

    <p>We also experimented with different formats such as Instagram Stories and Reels. Our reels, inspired by current meme trends and lighthearted humor, resonated well with our audience, with them reaching over 200 views. This style aligns really well with our approachable, playful brand identity. Stories were used not just to repost adventure-themed videos from other creators (which aligns with our values), but also to build community engagement. We asked followers questions like “What do you enjoy most when adventuring with your dog?” and received responses out of it, showing that our efforts to spark conversation did work. We also invited our audience to share their own adventure videos, and a few people did. Which we reposted, further strengthening that sense of community.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation of marketing objectives:</h3>

    <h4>objectives:</h4>

    <p>Reach Objective: Reach at least 300 people of our target audience on our social media platform within the first 4 weeks.</p>

    <p>Affect: Inspire and educate our target audience, making them feel confident about traveling with their dogs, leading to at least 50 meaningful interactions (likes, comments, shares).</p>

    <p>Response: Creating a community on our page by obtaining at least 150 followers.</p>

    <h4>1. Reach objective</h4>

    <p>We definitely achieved this objective. Looking at the reach, we have reached a lot more than 300 people. We aimed to reach at least 300 people within the first four weeks, this being 300 people from our target audience. We far surpassed this target. According to Instagram analytics, our profile reached 3,217 accounts during this period. This means that 3,2 thousand people have seen our posts in total. Of those, 68.1% were followers, and 31.9% were non-followers, suggesting that our hashtags were effective in expanding reach beyond our existing following. Our most viewed post was our very first reel, reinforcing the research that reels generate the highest visibility and work the best for getting the most reach. We have also seen that 55% from this reach is aged 18-24, and 26,5% is aged 25-34. The last age group is our target audience. This is less than we expected but if we calculate the percentage to a number, 26,5 percent of 3,217 are still 852 people from our intended target audience, which means we achieved our reach objective.</p>

    <h4>2. Affect objective</h4>

    <p>Looking at the affect, we also achieved our objective of having at least 50 interactions. According to our Instagram statistics, we have 186 interactions. These interactions range from likes, comments and shares. Interestingly, 90.4% of these came from our followers, which shows that we’re successfully building a loyal and engaged community. 84,1 percent out of the 186 interactions have been on normal posts. Which means that posts do work the best interaction wise, which is the opposite of which format gets the most reach. 179 out of the 186 have been likes and 6 have been comments. Which is a lot less than we anticipating. But we did get a lot more likes in total than we expected which was pleasantly surprising to see. But we did achieve our affect objective and surpassed it in a great way. We also received a few DMs with partnership offers, which was an exciting and unexpected bonus.</p>

    <h4>3. Response objective</h4>

    <p>Looking at the response objective, we also achieved this. Our goal was to gain at least 150 followers within four weeks. We obtained in total 168 followers. Which are quite a lot of people. We did not expect this number to be this high and we were even a little skeptical of reaching this objective. We in total have had 174 of which 5 unfollowed us.  However, this is still a very low number, this indicates that people not only found our content engaging but also chose to stick around, helping build a true community. In total we have shared 27 posts which helped us build that community. Within those posts, there was room and multiple occasions for engagement.</p>

    <h3>Key learnings</h3>

    <h4>What worked well</h4>

    <p>One of the most successful elements of the campaign was the use of Reels for reach. Reels significantly outperformed other types of content in terms of visibility, with our very first reel gaining over 200 views. This reinforced both our initial research and real-world results that Instagram’s algorithm tends to favor short-form video content, especially when it's engaging and on-trend.</p>

    <p>Another area that performed well was our use of Instagram Stories. We used Stories to ask interactive questions and repost user-generated content (UGC), which helped foster more genuine, two-way communication with our audience. Interestingly, we found that users were more willing to engage via Stories than to leave comments on static posts.</p>

    <p>Our consistent tone and aesthetic also proved effective. We stayed true to a joyful and adventurous visual identity, using bright and happy images, primarily of dogs exploring the outdoors. These visuals, paired with light-hearted and friendly captions, helped us build a strong brand presence that resonated with our target community.</p>

    <p>Audience growth exceeded our expectations. We set a goal of reaching 150 followers within four weeks and ended up with 168. We even received several direct messages with offers for collaborations, suggesting that our brand made a strong impression and connected well with a niche but engaged audience.</p>

    <h4>What did not work or went unexpectedly</h4>

    <p>However, not everything went as smoothly. One area that underperformed was comment engagement. Despite including open-ended questions in many of our captions, we received fewer comments than expected. We discovered that while users are happy to like a post or engage via Stories, getting them to comment on feed posts requires more compelling emotional or thought-provoking content, not just questions.</p>

    <p>Another challenge was overestimating the consistency of likes. We initially assumed that likes would gradually increase as our page grew, but engagement fluctuated quite a bit. Some posts we thought would perform well, especially those that were visually strong, underperformed, while others unexpectedly gained a lot of traction. This showed us how unpredictable engagement can be.</p>

    <p>User-generated content also had a slower start than anticipated. Although we did receive some submissions of dogs on adventures, participation was lower than expected. In hindsight, launching this aspect of the campaign with a clearer structure, like a branded hashtag challenge or a small incentive, might have encouraged more users to take part from the beginning.</p>

    <p>Another unexpected insight came from our reach demographics. We had assumed that most of our reach would come from our primary target group, ages 25–34. However, only 26.5% of the 3,217 people reached were within this age range. While this was lower than expected, it still equates to around 852 people from our target audience, which is a solid number and above our objective of 300 people. It showed us that we were successful in reaching our intended group, just not in the proportion we initially predicted.</p>

    <h4>What went as expected</h4>

    <p>Some aspects of the campaign did go exactly as planned. We followed our content calendar closely, posting three to four times per week, with only minor adjustments along the way. This helped maintain consistency and kept our audience engaged throughout the campaign.</p>

    <p>Our visual and messaging strategy also aligned perfectly with our goals. We set out to create a brand that celebrates fun, companionship, and adventure. And the feedback we received confirmed that this message resonated strongly with our audience.</p>

    <p>Lastly, our posting schedule was well-timed. Based on research, we decided to post during the afternoon, which proved effective in terms of both reach and engagement. The analytics backed this decision, showing higher performance during these times.</p>

    <h4>What did we learn</h4>

    <p>Overall, we learned how to actually execute a campaign and not just make one. For us, it was quite easy to follow our content calendar, we did make some changes along the way but followed it well. We also always tried to post them in the afternoon, which is when our target audience is the most on social media according to research. Instagram has the function to save concepts which made it easier to follow the time schedule. Looking at the KPI’s we set for each post on the content calendar we also achieved a lot of them, especially the following. The likes on the other hand we did not always reach. So that is something we overestimated. We expected it to be more every post but sometimes the likes went up and down. Because of that we learned that those kinds of interactions are hard to estimate.</p>

    <h4>What we would do differently</h4>

    <p>Something that we would do differently next time is to experiment more with reels. Since Reels brought in the most reach, we would create more short-form video content in the future, especially using trends or storytelling formats that are popular with our audience. Secondly, we would improve comment engagement. We would rethink how we encourage comments, perhaps by using more emotionally driven storytelling or adding stronger calls-to-action in captions. Collaborations or giveaways might also help boost comment rates. On top of that we would also do more with user-generated Content, since community-driven content got a strong response, we’d start collecting and showcasing user submissions earlier in the campaign.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p>In conclusion, our campaign not only met but exceeded all of our objectives. We gained valuable experience in creating and executing a full campaign, learned what types of content our audience connects with most, and laid a strong foundation for WanderPaws' future presence on social media. Most importantly, we began building a community of like-minded, dog-loving adventurers, exactly the kind of audience we set out to reach.</p>
          <h2 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h2>

<p>Reflecting on our completed campaign, it's clear that we laid a solid foundation in terms of building brand awareness, reaching our target audience, and establishing a community around our brand values. However, should this project continue, there are several opportunities to build on our success, improve engagement, and develop the campaign into a more strategic, long-term effort. This section outlines in detail what we would do differently, new ideas for content, and what I’ve learned through the process.</p>

<h3>Reflection on what has been done</h3>

<p>During this project, we focused on creating joyful, visually appealing content that aligns with our brand identity: playful, adventurous, and community focused. Our use of both photo posts and reels helped us discover that reels generate significantly more reach, while photo posts foster more consistent interaction (mainly likes). We also utilized Instagram Stories effectively to build direct engagement with our audience through questions and reposted content.</p>

<p>We hit all three of our initial objectives, by reaching over 3,200 people, sparking 186 interactions, and increasing our audience to 168 followers. But through this, we will identify clear areas where we could grow further, both in creative strategy and marketing structure.</p>

<h3>What we would do differently and why</h3>

<h4>1. Implement a long-term content strategy</h4>

<p>While our initial content calendar worked well for short-term consistency, future planning would benefit from a more strategic, long-term approach. We would create a 3-month content calendar with rotating content themes. Some ideas we have for this are “Training Tuesdays,” “Adventure Highlights,” “WanderPaws Wisdom”. This allows us to build expectations with our audience and explore a broader variety of topics. We would do this because content that follows themes is easier to plan and gives followers a reason to return. It also increases post consistency while giving the brand a clear voice.</p>

<h4>2. Prioritize Reels and storytelling content</h4>

<p>We saw from our analytics that reels received the most reach, yet we only created a few. If we continued the project, we would focus more on reels, and in them we would add more storytelling and narrative elements, such as “A day in the life of a traveling dog” or “Tips for packing for you and your pup.” These would combine value-driven content with emotional storytelling, encouraging shares and saves. This can be good for our brand as storytelling increases emotional resonance, which is key to building brand loyalty and shareable content. Reels are also favored by Instagram's algorithm, making them a priority format.</p>

<h4>3. Use a community Hashtag and UGC campaign</h4>

<p>To further grow our community, we would launch an official campaign hashtag, for example the hashtag: #WanderWithPaws. And encourage followers to use it when posting their own dog adventure photos or videos. Each week, we could feature our favorite submissions in a “Community Spotlight” post or story. We would do this because user-generated content (UGC) builds authenticity and strengthens community ties. According to Nielsen research, 92% of consumers trust UGC more than traditional advertising. It also provides ongoing content with minimal effort.</p>

<h4>4. Posting more carousel posts</h4>

<p>While most of our content was visual and emotive, we would introduce more educational carousel posts with practical advice, like “5 Tips for Road Tripping with Your Dog” or “Best Dog-Friendly Destinations in Europe.” Carousel posts increase time spent on each post, are highly shareable, and encourage saving, which boosts the algorithm performance of Instagram. They also reinforce our position as a helpful, knowledgeable resource and not just an aesthetic brand. These posts could mix text with icons or playful illustrations to stay on-brand while delivering useful info.</p>

<h4>5. Experiment with Collaborations and Micro-Influencers</h4>

<p>If we were to grow to a big brand with a budget. We could eventually reach out to micro-influencers in the pet travel niche for shoutouts, takeovers, or collaborative content. For example, a travel influencer with a dog could “take over” our stories for a day and share their travel routine, tagging us throughout. Influencer collaborations can really increase our brand reach. Micro-influencers are especially trusted and have stronger engagement rates than larger accounts, which is more valuable for community-focused brands.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If the campaign were to continue, we would shift the strategy from short-term visibility to long-term community building and brand authority. This would involve expanding our content types, deepening the storytelling, involving our audience more through UGC and collaborations, and keeping content both visually appealing and value-driven.</p>

<p>The campaign showed us the power of authentic branding and the importance of continuous testing and learning. By applying these insights, I believe WanderPaws could evolve into a lasting brand that shares a bond with a dog-loving community.</p>
